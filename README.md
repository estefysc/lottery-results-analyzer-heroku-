# Lottery Analyzer

## Introduction

### Project Description
This project extracts the results from the Florida Lotto website in order to do some number analysis. This is the code for the Heroku deployment. Due to specific Heroku requirements, this code will not run locally. If you are interested in running the code locally or seeing more details, such as tests, visit this [repo](https://github.com/estefysc/lottery-results-analyzer-app). The app can be accessed at the following url: [https://lottery-analyzer.herokuapp.com/](https://lottery-analyzer.herokuapp.com/). Note that the website will take a bit of time the first time is accessed as Heroku needs to activate the Dynos in which the website runs.
